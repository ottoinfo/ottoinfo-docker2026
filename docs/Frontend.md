# Otto+Info - Front End

- (Orb Local Service - ui.orb.local)(https://ui.orb.local)
- (Traefik Local Service - ui.ottoinfo.local)(https://ui.ottoinfo.local)

### How this should work

- we will use `stowrc` to create a symlink to repo
- you need to update your `.env`
- TODO - need to build it out

### Difficult Part

This will get us closer to using same files as PROD, but packages can be different.
Due to Linux and Mac
Need to decide what to do....
